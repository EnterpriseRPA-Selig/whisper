 I'm going to say you have no direct mandate from the electorate and no political leaders come back from the kind of poll ratings that you're currently enduring. What makes you want to go on? What I'm focused on is delivering for the British public. Now I recognise we have made mistakes. I'm sorry for those mistakes, but I've fixed the mistakes. I've appointed a new Chancellor. We have restored economic stability and fiscal discipline. And what I now want to do is go on and deliver for the public. We were elected on the 2019 manifesto. I'm determined to deliver on that. Leveling up, securing investment into all parts of our country, getting roads built, getting opportunities right across the nation. And that's what I'm thinking about and that's what I'm focused on.

 Hello, good afternoon. We start with breaking news. And a new poll of Conservative Party members has found that more than half think Liz Truss should resign as Prime Minister. You remember it was Conservative Party members who voted her in to replace Boris Johnson. Well, let's get the details for our Deputy Political Editor, Sam Coates. And, Sam, this was a survey of some more than 500 Conservative Party members. What have they told you? That's right, Jane, what a remarkable turnaround in just a matter of weeks from the people who put Liz Truss in number 10. Now, a majority appear to want them out. That's the conclusion of a UGov survey taken in the last few days of Tory Party members. Let's look at the headline results. Of the 530 Conservative members polled over the last two days, 55% have told UGov that they believe the Prime Minister should resign now. And when asked who should take over from Liz Truss, Boris Johnson comes top. 32% say that the former Prime Minister should take over the role once more. He, of course, was elected in 2019, the one with a Democratic mandate. The members want to go back to him with Rishi Sunak coming second on 23% of the vote and Ben Wallace coming third. So, a really striking set of results there showing that the chaos of the last few days, both in the market and at Conservative Party Conference, and this week with the firing of quasi-quatting on Friday, and the U-turns by Jeremy Hunt yesterday having a very real impact on what Tory members think of Liz Truss. Sam, they really are quite astonishing figures, aren't they? This year, we have a change between the next two weeks. The Lost Worldcon June 17th last after suffered many
