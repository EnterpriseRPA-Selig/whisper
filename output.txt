 How are you? How are you? Good, good, good. So yes, great news also. We've got the Monivast, top of the developer in Edmonton. So yeah, I think that will show us that on a specific tree. Of course, I just wanted to quickly send in the bank details of you now and then because obviously you've wrote them the money back to you and then obviously when we're actually here to prepare just the other property, we'll obviously we can, you know, we can, we'll request them from again from here. At that point, is that okay? Yes, perfect. Cool, great, great. Okay, okay, so, once again. So, help the HPC, you're in your name and I've got a count number, it's 40, 8143500 and the 4 code is 401184. Yes, exactly. Fantastic, fantastic. We'll all get those from down to the door. And then yeah, we can basically close that file up and then what we'll do is we'll, obviously we'll, we'll have a make-it-good program on the other one actually, you know, we're just waiting for those to quiet in choir, and it has a fingers in order. And yeah, we're just going to be too far from starting at 8 a.m. I don't know, just something to remember, I mean, we've just got to stop at either fluehold, perch, it's starting to go, and obviously one time, we've reviewed everything the freehold is unregistered, which is not unusual in that area, to be honest. It seems to be quite a lot of manchets doing around my area as well. So, it just really depends, the landlord is because this could be too outcome, basically. One is that the landlord is absent, which means that we can't establish the is, and in which case it's not going to be possible to buy a face-force basic. And then the old other about connes that he, you know, that, you know, that obviously might be a little messy. If they hold the title thing, the original thing, then we might still be able to buy it. And then fill it up so all along the investigation, and you will have a lot of people, you know, when I get to the top of the stuff anyway, yes. Yes, that's why that's what the body of face. Thank you. Yes. Okay, well, good feature, and I'll keep keeping foot on the property anyway, yes. Yes, thank you. Bye now, bye straight to you.
